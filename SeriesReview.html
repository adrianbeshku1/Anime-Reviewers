                    <h2>Tokyo Goul Written and Illustrated by Sui Ishida</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 9.2 out of 10 <a href="https://www.funimation.com/">Can be found on Funimation</a></h3>

                        Tells the story of Ken Kaneki, a university student, who after being attacked by a ghoul 
                        (supernatural beings who survive eating human flesh and hide in the secret among humans) 
                        manages to save himself by a transplant that makes him half-ghoul. Now Kaneki must have a 
                        new life hiding his identity among the dark streets of Tokyo.

                        I will be honest it does start off slow and doesn't pick up until the end of season 1, but 
                        it's really worth the wait. If you like a good plot and storyline it's here in this anime. 
                        It has lots of character development, a solid foundation, and it keeps you wondering. It also 
                        has just enough blood, gore, and action if you're into that! Overall it's a beautiful anime that 
                        I enjoyed I hope you enjoy it as well!

                    <h2>Fairy Tail Written and Illustrated by Hiro Mashima</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 8.8 out of 10 <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Can be found on Netflix</a></h3>

                        Lucy, a 17 year old girl, sets out on journey to become a full-fledged wizard and joins the strongest 
                        and most (in) famous guild FAIRY TAIL where she meets Natsu, Happy, Gray and Erza, who treat her more 
                        like family than friends. This epic series takes us through all the dangers that the members of fairy 
                        tail face and eventually overcome through mutual love and friendship.

                        I  like how fleshed out the story is, and it's incredible to see how invested I became in the series. 
                        I especially like the villains, without giving away any spoilers, the villains are awesome. Each one is 
                        unique and weird terrifying powers never before seen in other anime. A must watch.

                    <h2>Steins Gate Written and Illustrated by Yomi Sarachi</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 9.1 out of 10 <a href="https://www.funimation.com/">Can be found on Funimation</a></h3>

                        Steins Gate is about an eccentric mad scientist called Okabe Rintarou and his two lab members, Shiina Mayuri 
                        and Daru formed this lab called the "Future Gadget Research Laboratory" where they make futuristic gadgets . 
                        However, all of their inventions are extremely boring and useless, and the only one that's even remotely interesting 
                        is the Phone Microwave which turns bananas into oozing green gel. But, when Okabe sends a text message to Daru,
                        whose phone was connected to the phone microwave, he discovers that the phone microwave can send text messages
                        into the past. And what's more, the words they send can affect the flow of time, and have unforeseen, far reaching 
                        consequences that Okabe may not be able to handle.

                        I love this entire series. The character progression is amazing. The way the story is told is amazing. It is probably 
                        my favorite anime of all time. However, it does start off slow, for me Okabe was a really strange character to deal 
                        with for the first couple of episodes. Once I started to understand what was going on and the plot progressed I couldn't stop watching.
