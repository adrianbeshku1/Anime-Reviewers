        <p2 id = "aboutBody">
            In the West, anime is a term short for "animation" and is used to describe any type of animated works made in Japan. 
            However, the Japanese definition of anime includes any kind of animation, even if it’s made outside of Japan. 
            How is it that Japanese animation became so special and iconic that the rest of the world decided to distinguish it 
            from others? The answer to that is hard to pin down and there might not be just one reason. Looking at history of anime 
            may shed some light on what makes Japan’s animation different from the rest of the world.
