                    <h2>A Silent Voice Written by Yoshitoki Oima, Reiko Yoshida, Kiyoshi Shigematsu</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 8.2 out of 10 <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Can be found on Netflix</a></h3>

                        A deaf girl, Shoko, joins a new school and is immediately the target of the class bully, Shoya. This causes her 
                        to leave the school and him to become ostracized by his classmates. A few years pass and Shoya sets out to find 
                        Shoko and redeem himself.
                        The film's brilliant pacing and expertly woven narrative deliver an empowering story that will stick with you long 
                        after the credits roll. The beautiful backgrounds, well realized characters and stunning animation go a long way in 
                        elevating the film's emotional impact, making for one of the most touching and powerful movies I have seen all year.

                    <h2>Dragon Ball Z Battle of Gods Written by Yūsuke Watanabe</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 7.9 out of 10 <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/">Can be found on Crunchyroll</a></h3>

                        Battle of Gods’ first act introduces us to the smarmy, cat-like God of Destruction, Lord Beerus. He may look small and 
                        purple, but looks can be deceiving. Even though no one has mentioned him throughout DBZ’s 291-episode run, we learn 
                        about him through some fun cameos by the lovable and knowledgeable Kais. It turns out Beerus cat-napped through some 
                        of the most epic battles in history, after instructing Frieza to destroy planet Vegeta, home of the Saiyans. It’s neat 
                        for viewers to learn that Frieza had some orders from above, but what’s more interesting is how Beerus reacts to someone 
                        defeating the ruthless Galactic Emperor.
                        The whole scene basically acts as a Saiyan history lesson for those who aren’t quite up to date on how the powerful, 
                        gold-haired fighters work. While the recap is nice, I was also hoping to see an example of Beerus’ strength here, 
                        but instead, he simply reveals his vision of a mighty Super Saiyan God who looks exactly like Goku, and how he must take
                        this arch-rival out, even if it involves destroying Earth.

                    <h2>Violet Evergarden Written by Kana Akatsuki, Reiko Yoshida</h2>
                    <h3>Rated a 8.8 out of 10 <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Can be found on Netflix</a></h3>
                    
                        Violet Evergarden is in my mind some of the best anime ever made. It's not for everyone. It's a slow-burner and very emotional.
                        This movie is even moreso, with parts of it admittedly a bit too over the top in the emotional aspect. Yet it holds true to the
                        story and has a very nice ending.

                        Before watching this movie I recommend watching the Evergarden series and the prior movie; otherwise a large part of this won't
                        have the emotion impact it requires. The movie stands on its own, but just barely. The backstory of the prior episodes are
                        essential to understanding the real point and nature of this film.
